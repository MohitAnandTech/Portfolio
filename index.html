            punjab named Batala.Our state Punab is very famous for its rich and<br>
            cultural heritage. Many different types of people live in here<br>

        <h3>Aim and Education</h3>
            <p>
    After completing my high school,I decided to move abroad<br> 
    for my further higher studies.My aim is to become a well<br>
    profound <span style= "color: #000080;">software engineer </span> in a
    <br> multi national company. So I decided to start studying<br>
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology" target="_blank">
    information technology</a> in australia, one of the most reliable<br>
    country for international students and also rich in their standard<br>
    of livings and education.
            </p>
            <p> After comming to melbourne, Australia, my life became<br>
            <br> very struggleful.No one is here who is my own and with<br>
            whom I can share my views.I have to do all of my things and<br>
            stuff my own in order to earn my livings and stay here. <br>
    I took admission in one of the well renowned universty of australia i.e.<br> 
    <a href="http://scu.edu.au/" target="_blank"> Southern cross university</a>,
    also know as SCU. It comes in top 10 universities in australia and is also<br> 
    very famous for its international student support service.</p>

            <p> Students come from different parts of the world to study here.<br> 
    My classmates are all from different counties and have different native<br> 
    languages.So we all always talk to each other and share our ideas in<br>
    english language only. English is the comon language that is used among<br>
    all the students, teachers and different people around ausralia.<br>
    A person has to be always hardworking and focussed towards his/her goal in<br> 
    order to achieve success in his career.</p><br>
